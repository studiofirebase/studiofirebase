## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep violet (#7950F2) to evoke feelings of innovation, creativity, and trustworthiness.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F2F5), almost the same hue as the primary color, for a clean, modern backdrop that ensures readability and focus on the content.
- Accent color: A vivid rose (#E0318A), an analogous color to the primary violet, to draw attention to key interactive elements and highlight promotions.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif), ideal for drawing attention in titles and headings, thanks to its fashionable and artful styling.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) because blocks of text are likely in the editorial product sales content, and this font is both contemporary and literary.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent categories, actions, and social media platforms. Ensure consistency in style and size for a polished look.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure content is well-organized and easily accessible. Prioritize a mobile-first approach to design, ensuring responsiveness across all devices.
